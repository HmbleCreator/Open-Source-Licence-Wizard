## Introduction

![Banner Image](./assets/Isabella.png)

The **Open Source License Wizard** is an interactive Streamlit application designed to assist developers in selecting the most appropriate open-source license for their projects. With its enchanting starry interface and intuitive questionnaire, this wizard simplifies the often complex process of license selection.

**New Feature Alert**: We have integrated advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques into the License Wizard, enabling it to recommend suitable licenses with an accuracy of **85-90%** in most cases. This enhancement allows developers to make more informed decisions that align with their project goals, community expectations, and legal requirements.

## Features

### Key Features

- **Interactive Questionnaire**: Answer a series of questions tailored to your project and preferences.
- **NLP-Powered License Recommendation Engine**: Utilizes NLP to analyze user inputs and recommend the most suitable open-source licenses.
- **Enchanting User Interface**: A visually appealing starry night sky background with animated elements creates an engaging experience.
- **Detailed License Information**: Key features and points for each recommended license are provided for better understanding.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.

## How It Works

### How It Works Diagram

The Open Source License Wizard employs a sophisticated scoring system enhanced by NLP to match user preferences with license features. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Loading**: The application loads license data and questions from JSON files.
2. **User Input**: Users answer questions through an interactive interface.
3. **NLP Processing**: The NLP engine analyzes the input to understand user intent and context.
4. **Scoring**: Each license is scored based on its alignment with user preferences.
5. **Recommendation**: The top-scoring licenses are presented as recommendations.
