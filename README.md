The Open Source License Wizard is an interactive Streamlit application designed to help developers choose the most appropriate open-source license for their projects. With its enchanting starry interface and intuitive questionnaire, this wizard simplifies the often complex process of license selection.

Our goal is to empower developers to make informed decisions about licensing their open-source projects, ensuring that their chosen license aligns with their project goals, community expectations, and legal requirements.

## Features

Features Overview

- **Interactive Questionnaire**: Users answer a series of questions about their project and preferences.
- **License Recommendation Engine**: Based on user responses, the wizard calculates and recommends the most suitable open-source licenses.
- **Enchanting User Interface**: A visually appealing starry night sky background with animated elements creates an engaging user experience.
- **Detailed License Information**: Provides key features and points for each recommended license.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes and devices.

## How It Works

How It Works Diagram

The Open Source License Wizard uses a scoring system to match user preferences with license features. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. **Data Loading**: The application loads license data and questions from JSON files.
2. **User Input**: Users answer questions through an interactive interface.
3. **Scoring**: Each license is scored based on how well it matches the user's preferences.
4. **Recommendation**: The top-scoring licenses are presented as recommendations.
